Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.

## Step 2 : Fork the Project

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Reeponame
$ cd Reeponame
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ownwerusername/Reeponame
```




- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.
```
$ git remote update
$ git checkout <branch-name>
$ git rebase upstream/<branch-name>
```
## Step 3 : Branch
Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.
```
